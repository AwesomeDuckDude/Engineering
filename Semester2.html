This week in Engineering we learned about chemical engineering, and started an 8 week long projoct.
<br>
<br>
We didnt have aschool on monday so on tuesday we went over some slides on chemical engineering, and learned about what all the different branches do.
<br>
<br>
Then on wednesday we got introduced to our new project that we wil be working on for the next 8 weeks, you had to chose one of two projects, I chose to make a mousetrap car.
<br>
<br>
Then on thursday we worked mor on planning for our mousetrap cars, and had a quiz on chemical engineering on friday.

In the past two weeks we made non newtonian fluid, and finishec the CAD fro out mousetrap car
<br>
<br>
For our mousetrap car, my group is going for a simple design that has a big back wheel, small front wheels, and a long arm to help move it.
<br>
<br>
Next week we are planning to satrt building the body of our car.

Last week in engineering we started to work on our mousetrap cars, my group worked on the body and the wheels of the car.
<br>
<br>
Our goal for this week is to finish our first car design, and test it to see what we can improve upon.

Last week in engineering, we finished out first car design, tested it, then started to work on our second car.
<br>
<br>
On tuesday and wednesday we worked on finishing out first design then getting ready to test it.
<br>
<br>
Then on thursday we started to test our car and check what we can improve on in our next design.
<br>
<br>
Then on friday, we started to work on our second car design, using what we learned in the first design to make it better.

This week in engineering we finished our final mousetrap car designs, and did our final tests.
<br>
<br>
Our car design was long and skinny so that we could minimize weight, and maximize the ammount of string used, in the end our car preformed better than expected, our mousetrap car was able to go across the cafeteria before stopping.
<br>
<br>
Our first car desgin went around 25ft, and our second car went over 50ft, so our second design went double the distance of our first design.
<br>
<br>
In the end our mousetrap car was able to go the full ditance of the cafeteria, if I could make another car then I would change the wheels since the car did turn a bit while testing.

This week in engineering we started our next project and had an engineering challenge.
<br>
<br>
At the begining of the week we were introduced to our next engineering project, we were put into groups of 3-4 people and we have to make an egg drop device.
<br>
<br>
After we were told about the project we were given two days to make a CAD for our device.
<br>
<br>
Then on thursday we had a challenge where we had to work in groups of 2 to make a device that could as close as possible to a set target, my group landed 47 inches away from the target.
<br>
<br>
Finally on friday we finished our CAD, overall I would say our design is pretty good, but two of the sides of the design arent as protected as they could be.
