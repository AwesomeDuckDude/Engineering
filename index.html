           This week in engineering we started our engineering webstite by first pasting the website template into our code, then we made a few changes like changing the name of our website, adding an image, and changing the background color. For my website I chose kirby as the image since he is the character I main in super smash bros ultimate, then I added a pink background since it matches Kirby.

           The next day we went over some important presentations about the engineering processes and proper safety procedures that we have to practice, it was pretty boring but I still payed attention cause I knew it was important.

           Then on thursday we had our first challenge day, we were split up into two teams and had to use pvc pipes to transport a marble into a cup. The challenge seemed easy until we realized that there werent enough pipes to tranport the marbel to the end. The strategy my team used was to keep moving and make sure the marbel went slow. Although my team didnt finsih, we still had a good time and made it very close to the cup.
