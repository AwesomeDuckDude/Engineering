           This week in engineering we started our engineering webstite, first we copied and pasted the website template into our code, then we made a few changes like changing the name of our website, adding an image, and changing the background color. For my website I chose kirby as the image since he is the character I main in super smash bros ultimate, then I added a pink background since it matches Kirby.
            <br>
            <br>
           The next day we went over some important presentations about the engineering processes and proper safety procedures that we have to practice, it was pretty boring but I still payed attention cause I knew it was important.

            <br>
           Then on thursday we had our first challenge day, we were split up into two teams and had to use pvc pipes to transport a marble into a cup. The challenge seemed easy until we realized that there werent enough pipes to tranport the marbel to the end. The strategy my team used was to keep moving and make sure the marbel went slow. Although my team didnt finish, we still had a good time and made it very close to the cup.

            Finnaly on friday we made our first journal entry which is what you just read, I also added a pretty good caramel apple recipe bellow.

            <br>
            Over this weekend im going to play the new Fortnite season with some of my friends. Im also going to go to Honalulu so that I can participate in the Pokemon Go Fest Global 2023 even and hopefully catch a Mega Rayquaza which is my favorite Pokemon.</font>

            This week in engineering we started off the week by going over some slides on the different types of Mechanical Engineering, and what they are all focused on. We also reviewed the propper outfit to have while in the lab which inclides safety glasses, gloves, apron, safety helmet, safety boots, and masks.
            <br>
            <br>
            The next day after we finished reviewing mechanical engineering, Mr. Poole told us that were going to make a Rube Goldberg Machine that starts with a baseball, and ends by popping a baloon with a needle. Everyone designed their own goldberg machine, then we split up into groups of 3-4 where we designed a machine using everyones original design.
            <br>
            <br>
            Then on wednesday we had a worksheet on the Mechanical Engineering slides that we went over earlier that week. After we finished the worksheet we went back into our groups and made a lsit of all the materials that we'd need for the goldberg machine.
           <br>
           <br>
           On thursday we had our first challenge day where everyone had to make a home applience in tinkercad, I made a refrigerator and was one of the two winners.
           <br>
           <br>
            Finnaly on friday we had our first quiz on the Engineering Process and Safety slides that we went over the previous week, after the quiz we made our second weekly website update.
            <br>
            <br>
            This weekend im going to play the Charmander Community Day for Pokemon Go, and relax at home for our 3 day weekend.

            This week in engineering we started our first project which was to make a Rube Goldberg Machine that starts with a baseball and ends by popping a baloon with a needle.
            <br>
            <br>
            This week was kind of rushed since we had an assembly, map tests, a minimum day, and back to school night, the main goal of the week was to create our project blueprint on tinkerCAD then hopfully start working on our building it.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the first 2 days of the week my group just worked on TinkerCAD, everyone worked on a different section of the machine so that we could finish as fast aas posible, we finished right before class ended on wednesday.
            <br>
            <br>
            On thursday we didnt do much, we started by making the platform where the baseball would start, but we only made it half way through before class ended. For our projecy my group is planning to use two pulleys, a lever, an inclined plane, and a wheel and axel, I think the hardest park is going to be making the pulleys.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally on friday wwe had a short quiz on Mechanical Engineering, then we just worked on our website updates for the rest of class.
